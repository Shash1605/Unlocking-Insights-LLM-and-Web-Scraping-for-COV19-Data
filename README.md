# Unlocking-Insights-LLM-and-Web-Scraping-for-COV19-Data
# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It includes data collection via web scraping, preprocessing, and various exploratory data analysis techniques to gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Web scraping using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, cleaning, and structuring the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Data Insights**: Identifying trends and patterns in COVID-19 cases.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **BeautifulSoup** (for web scraping)

## Installation
